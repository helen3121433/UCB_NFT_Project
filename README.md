## Background
NFT(non-fungible token)
An NFT is a digital sset that represents real world object like art, music, in-game items and videos. All of these are broght and sold online, freqently with cryptocurrency. 
The most expensive NFT ever was sold on December 2, 2021, for a total cost of 
$91.8M. NFT is a fast-growing market and we propose to explore market trends 
and user behavior on NFT prices & demand in the coming Web 3.0. 

## Motivation 
Cryptocurrency has become a household name and is an evolving technology 
that will only become more prevalent in digital finance. There is a need to explore
the infrastructure of this technology and assess & predict various aspects of the 
blockchain ecosystem.

## Questions to answer
1. What NFTs are popular on the Solana platform ?
2. Among the most popular NFT collection on Solona platform, what are the top 10 attributes that affect the price ?

## Tools/Modules to use

## Data sets to use
Dataset were pull from Kaggle, and Github that were uploaded by Ali Nabipour. It represents the most popular Solana-based collections lited in Magiceden market. From March 2022 - Mid-April 2022.
Datasets included: 
1. collections.csv file that contains gerneral information about collections.
2. Collection directory that contains data of NFTs that are listed in market place.

- https://github.com/eyenpi/solana-nft-collections/tree/f7ca6ea6ffe11c309c01583a3e79302b6b681793

## Plans on data cleaning 
1. Drop columns that will not be used.
2. Add a columns with version(v1,v2,v3,v4)
3. Only keep collections that appears all 4 collections
4. Merge/Join collection basic information and NFT sold by each collections.
5. Sort by/group by collection name.
6. Collect # of NFT were sold for each collections
7. Pick top 7 colletions, and use regular expression to split the column 'attribute'
8. Create new attribute columns by trait type as header, trait value as cell.

## Steps for Loading Dataset into Amazon RDS Using pgAdmin
1. Create Amazon RDS database
2. Create connection to Amazon database using pgAdmin
3. Write SQL query in pgAdmin to create NFT database tables
4. Import NFT data files into pgAdmin

## Machine Learning Model

### Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data model, we used one hot encoding to convert categorial attributes into a format that will improve the predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms

### Modeling
We chose scikit-learn as the framework for our machine learning model development. To traing and validate our model, we split the features and the target sets into trainng and testing sets. Our training and testing data sets are 67% and 33% respectively of the original data. To improve the accuracy of the final results, we combing multiple models including random forest, linear regression and huber regression for the data training and testsing.

## Dashboard
To create the dashboard, the platform `Heroku` (https://www.heroku.com/) will be utlized. In order to utilize this website various boilerplate Flash files will be utlized to create a multi-layered webpage. Both Jinja, BootStrap, Flask, Pip, and others will be utlized for this dashboard deployment. The website will contain the main data findings of price versus attributes, while also having the ability to explore more specific NFT data collections.
