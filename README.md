## Background
The most expensive NFT ever was sold on December 2, 2021, for a total cost of 
$91.8M. NFT is a fast-growing market and we propose to explore market trends 
and user behavior on NFT prices & demand in the coming Web 3.0. 

## Motivation 
Cryptocurrency has become a household name and is an evolving technology 
that will only become more prevalent in digital finance. There is a need to explore
the infrastructure of this technology and assess & predict various aspects of the 
blockchain ecosystem.

## Questions to answer

1. What types of NFTs are popular in the market or are becoming increasingly
popular?
2. Are there correlations between the different types of NFT buyers and 
sellers, and its impact on NFT prices?
3. How is the value of NFT’s measured and predicted using exploratory data 
analysis of market data and social media interactions
